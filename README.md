To run the app on a local developement environement do as follows :
- run `npm install`.
- To run the front `cd client` and then `npm start`, then navigate to `http://localhost:4200`.
- To run the back `cd server` and then `npm run start:dev`, the server is run on port `3000`.
- You need to have a Google API key linked to the Google Book's API and add to the `.env` file (see `.env.example`).
